A <div> displaying the total number of characters typed, which updates dynamically.

JavaScript (script.js):
The function showcount() is triggered whenever the user types in the textarea (using the oninput event).

It takes the current value of the textarea.

Calculates its length (number of characters).

Updates the <span id="charcount"> to show the live character count on the screen.

CSS (style.css):

The .container class centers and styles the main section.

The <textarea> is styled with padding, border, and fixed height for a neat input box.
