A Command Line Interface (CLI) application is a text-based program where users interact with the system by typing commands. In this experiment:

Node.js is used as the runtime environment to execute JavaScript outside the browser.

readline-sync module is used to take synchronous input from the user in the terminal.

Array is used as an in-memory data structure to store employee details such as id, name, and role.

Functions are created for adding, viewing, and deleting employee records.

A menu-driven program is implemented using loops and switch-case to give users multiple options.

This experiment helps in understanding the basics of Node.js, synchronous input handling, and performing array operations like push(), forEach(), findIndex(), and splice().

Algorithm / Steps

Start the program.

Initialize an empty array to store employees.

Display a menu with options:

Add Employee

View Employees

Delete Employee

Exit

If the user selects Add Employee, ask for id, name, and role, then insert into the array.

If the user selects View Employees, display all records from the array.

If the user selects Delete Employee, ask for employee id and remove the matching record from the array.

If the user selects Exit, terminate the program.

Repeat steps 3â€“7 until the user chooses to exit.
