This project demonstrates how to create a simple RESTful API using Node.js and the Express framework. The API manages a collection of playing cards stored in memory and supports the four main CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Features Implemented

Data Representation

A sample in-memory card collection is maintained as an array of objects.

Each card has:

id: Unique identifier

suit: The suit of the card (e.g., Hearts, Spades)

value: The value of the card (e.g., Ace, King)

API Endpoints

GET /cards

Returns the full list of cards in JSON format.

POST /cards

Adds a new card to the collection.

Automatically assigns an incremental id.

PUT /cards/:id

Updates an existing card by its id.

If the card is not found, returns a 404 error.

DELETE /cards/:id

Deletes a card from the collection by its id.

If the card is not found, returns a 404 error.

Error Handling

Invalid id requests are handled gracefully with proper error messages.

Ensures data integrity by validating existence before update or delete operations.

Execution

The server runs on http://localhost:3000.

JSON is used for both request input and response output.
