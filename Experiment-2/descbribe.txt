Features Implemented

HTML Structure

A container div centers the entire content on the page.

Inside it, the inner-container holds:

A Balance Display ($15 shown by default).

Two action buttons: Deposit and Withdraw.

CSS Styling & Layout

The outer container (.container) uses Flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally (justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh).

The inner box (.inner-container) is styled with:

Size: 500px Ã— 500px

Background color: aquamarine

Rounded corners (border-radius: 20px)

Flexbox column layout to align balance text and buttons.

Balance section (.balance)

Green text, larger font size, centered.

Buttons section (.buttons)

Uses column layout with gap: 10px for spacing.

Each button styled with padding, rounded edges, and hover-friendly design.

Deposit button = red, Withdraw button = green (colors can be swapped for clarity).

Execution

The interface opens in a web browser with the balance displayed at the center of the screen.

Buttons are clickable but not functional (no transaction logic implemented).
