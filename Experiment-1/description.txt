This project is about creating a student registration form using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The form collects student details such as Name, Email, and Age and includes built-in validation.

The HTML form uses input types like text, email, and number. Validation is handled with attributes:

required ensures fields cannot be left empty.

minlength and maxlength restrict the length of the name.

min and max limit the age between 10 and 100.

The CSS part improves the design by setting a background color (antiquewhite), centering the form, adding padding, margin, and rounded corners. Flexbox (display: flex; flex-direction: column;) is used to align form elements neatly, and the heading is styled for better readability.

When submitted, the form sends data to /submit (backend can be added later). This experiment shows how HTML5 form validation combined with CSS styling can create a user-friendly and well-structured registration form.
