This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic product listing page with a filter-by-category feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system displays a list of products and allows users to filter them based on selected categories such as T-Shirts, Jeans, Electronics, and Books.

Features Implemented

HTML Structure

The page consists of:

A title (h1) for the product list.

A filter dropdown (select) for category selection.

An unordered list (ul) where products are dynamically displayed.

JavaScript Functionality

A predefined array of products is created with name and category.

Dynamic Rendering:

Products are displayed in the list using DOM manipulation.

Filter Feature:

The renderProducts() function filters products based on the selected category.

If "All" is selected, every product is shown.

If no products match, a message “No products found in this category” is displayed.

Event Handling:

The change event on the dropdown triggers re-rendering of the product list.

CSS Styling

A clean, modern design with:

Centered container with padding, rounded corners, and shadow.

Styled dropdown (select) for category filtering.

Product items (li) styled with borders, spacing, and hover transition.

Uses responsive layout with a max-width of 600px for better readability.

Execution

When the page loads, all products are shown by default.

Users can filter the products dynamically without refreshing the page.
