This project is a small web application that displays a list of products and allows filtering them by category. It is created using HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity.

HTML Part:
Defines the layout – a heading, a dropdown menu for selecting categories, and an empty list where products will appear.

CSS Part:
Styles the page with a clean interface. It centers the container, adds padding, shadows, and rounded corners. The product items are displayed as neat cards with spacing and hover effects for a modern look.

JavaScript Part:
Handles the logic of filtering products.

A product array stores names and categories.

The renderProducts() function shows products based on the selected category.

If “All” is chosen, everything is displayed. Otherwise, only items of that category are shown.

If no product exists in a category, a message is displayed.

An event listener updates the product list whenever the user changes the dropdown option.
