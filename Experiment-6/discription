This project is a Freehand Drawing Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). It allows users to draw freely on a canvas by dragging their mouse, similar to a simple paint tool.

HTML Part:

Sets up the page with a heading and an <svg> element that acts as the drawing canvas.

The SVG element provides a scalable and resolution-independent surface for drawing paths.

CSS Part:

Styles the page with a clean look.

The drawing canvas has a border, a white background, and a crosshair cursor to make drawing easier.

Basic spacing and text styling are added for readability.

JavaScript Part (Core Logic):

Handles the drawing process by listening to mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseleave).

On mousedown, a new SVG <path> is created, starting at the mouse position.

On mousemove, as the user drags the mouse, new line segments (L x,y) are added to the path, creating a continuous stroke.

On mouseup or mouseleave, the drawing stops.

A helper function calculates the mouse position relative to the canvas.
