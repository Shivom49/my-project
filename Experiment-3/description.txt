This project demonstrates how to build a responsive Admin Dashboard using HTML and CSS with a Dark Mode toggle feature. The layout is created using CSS Grid, and color theming is controlled with CSS custom properties (variables).

Features Implemented

HTML Structure

The dashboard is divided into four main sections:

Header → Contains the dashboard title and dark mode toggle.

Sidebar (Navigation) → Links to Home, User, and Settings pages.

Main Content → Displays the admin welcome message and page content.

Footer → Copyright information.

A checkbox (#darkModeToggle) is used to control dark mode styling via CSS.

CSS Styling & Layout

CSS Grid Layout:

Defines header, sidebar, main, and footer using grid-template-areas.

Custom Properties (CSS Variables):

Default header color: #5eb5c0.

When dark mode is toggled, header color changes to #4f2c50.

Sidebar Styling:

Vertical navigation menu with spacing (gap: 100px).

Responsive Design:

Layout adapts to full height (100vh) and organizes content neatly.

Dark Mode Toggle (CSS-Only Implementation)

The checkbox input acts as the switch.

When checked (input:checked ~ .dashboard), the CSS variable --bg-color-header changes, altering the dashboard theme.

Demonstrates theme switching without JavaScript.

Execution

By default, the dashboard opens in light mode.

When the toggle is activated, the theme switches to dark mode dynamically.
