CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates software delivery.
Whenever code is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions triggers a workflow defined in a .yml file that:

Checks out the code.

Installs dependencies and builds the React app.

Builds a Docker image using docker buildx.

Pushes the image to Docker Hub automatically using secure credentials.

This process ensures that each new version of the app is automatically containerized and available for deployment without manual Docker commands.

Software / Tools Used:

GitHub Actions – for workflow automation

Docker Hub – for image hosting

Docker Desktop – for local verification

Node.js 18 – for React build process

VS Code / Terminal – for development

Procedure:

Created a folder structure:

my-project/
  └── .github/
      └── workflows/
          └── ci-cd.yml


Added the workflow file with build and deploy jobs.

Set up GitHub repository secrets:

DOCKER_USERNAME → Docker Hub username

DOCKER_PASSWORD → Docker Hub access token

Committed and pushed the workflow file:

git add .
git commit -m "Added CI/CD pipeline workflow"
git push


GitHub Actions automatically ran the pipeline:

Installed dependencies (npm install)

Built React app (npm run build)

Built Docker image using docker buildx build with proper context

Pushed image to Docker Hub (shivomparashari/my-project:latest)

Verified success in Actions tab (green checkmark) and Docker Hub repository.

Result:

Successfully implemented a CI/CD pipeline that automatically:

Builds and tests the React app on every push.

Builds a Docker image and deploys it to Docker Hub.

Reduces manual deployment effort and ensures continuous delivery of updated builds.
