In this experiment, I created a React component called ProductCard to display product details such as name, price, and stock status using props.

The main objective was to understand reusability of components and how props are used to pass data.

I displayed a list of products (Wireless Mouse, Keyboard, and Monitor) inside a parent component App.

Styling was applied using CSS to arrange the products in card format with proper alignment.

Through this, I learned how to design reusable UI components and display data dynamically in React.
