 FEATURE: Person Class Hierarchy Component

The application demonstrates the concept of inheritance in JavaScript using ES6 classes within a React component.

It introduces a base `Person` class with properties like name and age, along with subclasses `Student` and `Teacher` that extend `Person`.

The React component (`App.tsx`) provides an interactive UI where users can click buttons to view details of either a Student or a Teacher instance.

2. PAGE STRUCTURE (React Component Overview)

The React component structure consists of:

- A main wrapper <div> styled as a card for layout and design.
- A header <h2> displaying “Person Class Hierarchy”.
- Two buttons: “Show Student” and “Show Teacher” that trigger state updates to display information.
- A horizontal line <hr /> for separation.
- A paragraph <p> that dynamically displays details based on which button is clicked.

3. CSS LAYOUT & STYLING

The design follows a clean and card-based layout:

- A centered container styled with margin, padding, and a shadow.
- Buttons styled with background color, hover effects, and spacing for clarity.
- Typography is consistent with a bold header and normal body text.
- Responsive design ensures it adapts to different screen sizes.

4. COLOR SCHEME

- Card Background: White.
- Borders/Shadow: Light gray for subtle depth.
- Buttons: Blue background with white text for strong visibility.
- Text: Black for maximum readability.
