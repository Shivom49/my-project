In this experiment, I implemented object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript using ES6 classes and inheritance.

A base class Person was created with common properties (name, age) and a method introduce().

Two subclasses were derived:

Student → extended Person, added a grade property and a study() method.

Teacher → extended Person, added a subject property and a teach() method.

The project was integrated with HTML + CSS + JavaScript so that users could click buttons to display Student and Teacher details.

This experiment gave me hands-on experience with OOP principles like inheritance, constructor chaining, and method overriding in JavaScript.
