In this experiment, I built a Library Management system UI using React with the following features:

Search: Filter books by title or author dynamically.

Add Book: Enter new book details and add them to the list.

Remove Book: Delete books from the list using a button.

The initial book list contained sample data such as 1984, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird.

The project helped me practice state management with React hooks (useState) and event handling.

I also worked on proper UI design with CSS to make it match the expected output and align the component in the center of the browser.

This experiment strengthened my skills in React state handling, forms, and list rendering.
